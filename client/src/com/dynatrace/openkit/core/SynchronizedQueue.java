/**
 * SynchronizedQueue is an implementation of a data structure that fulfills the following requirements:
 * - has to be thread-safe for access from multiple threads
 * - should be non-blocking for performance reasons
 * - random-delete has to be possible
 * - first-in, first-out
 * - shallow copies should be possible
 * - should be easy to clear
 * <p>
 * As there was no real fit in the Java 6 JDK data structures, this is a simple self-made implementation.
 * It's for sure not the best-performing implementation and it could make sense to introduce upper bounds, but it works well enough.
 *
 * @param <T> type of items in the queue instance
